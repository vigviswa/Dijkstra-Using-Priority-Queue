# Dijkstra-Using-Priority-Queue

# Statement:

1) Implements Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm for finding the shortest path from a vertex to all other vertices.

2) The graph contains at least 10 vertices and 20 edges.

3) Prints the Shortest Path Tree.

4) Uses the Min Heap or the Priority Queue to implement the algorithm.
